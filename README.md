# Maze Solver - DFS Implementation

An educational implementation of a maze solver using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm. This project is designed for learning fundamental algorithms and contributing to open source.

## What is This?

This project demonstrates how to solve mazes using DFS, a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It's useful for:
- Learning about graph algorithms
- Understanding recursion and backtracking
- Contributing to open source projects
- Visualizing algorithm behavior

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Running the Maze Solver

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the solver on all example mazes and display the solutions.

## How It Works

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm

DFS explores a maze by:
1. **Starting** at the initial position (S)
2. **Exploring** one direction as far as possible
3. **Marking** visited positions to avoid cycles
4. **Backtracking** when hitting a dead end
5. **Finding** the goal position (E)

### Code Structure

```
maze_solver/
├── maze.py           # Maze representation and utilities
├── dfs_solver.py     # DFS algorithm implementation
├── example_mazes.py  # Pre-defined test mazes
├── main.py           # Main entry point
└── README.md         # This file
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Maze Class** (`maze.py`)
Represents the maze as a 2D grid where:
- `0` = walkable path
- `1` = wall
- `'S'` = start position
- `'E'` = end position

#### 2. **DFSSolver Class** (`dfs_solver.py`)
Implements the DFS algorithm with:
- Recursive exploration
- Visited tracking
- Path reconstruction
- Statistics collection

#### 3. **Example Mazes** (`example_mazes.py`)
Provides test mazes of varying difficulty:
- **Simple**: Great for beginners (5x5)
- **Medium**: Requires backtracking (8x8)
- **Complex**: Many dead ends (10x10)
- **Spiral**: Interesting pattern (7x7)
- **Impossible**: No solution (demonstrates correctness)

## Understanding the Output

When you run the program, you'll see:

```
Original Maze:
S . . . .
█ █ █ █ .
. . . . .
. █ █ █ █
. . . . E

Maze with Solution Path (marked with *):
S * * * .
█ █ █ █ *
. . . . *
. █ █ █ █
. . . . E

Statistics:
  - Path length: 9 steps
  - Nodes visited: 13
  - Efficiency: 69.23%
```

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Here are some ideas:

### For Beginners:
1. **Add new example mazes** in `example_mazes.py`
2. **Improve documentation** with more explanations
3. **Add comments** to explain tricky parts of the code

## Testing Your Changes

After making changes, run the program to ensure everything works:

```bash
python main.py
```

Check that:
- All solvable mazes find solutions
- The impossible maze reports "No solution"
- The output is clear and readable

## Ideas for Extensions

- **Multiple algorithms**: Compare DFS, BFS, A*, Dijkstra
- **Maze generator**: Create random mazes
- **3D mazes**: Extend to three dimensions
- **Weighted paths**: Different terrain costs
- **Animation**: Show the algorithm in action
- **File I/O**: Load mazes from files
- **Web interface**: Make it accessible online

## Code Style

- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Comment complex logic
